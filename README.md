This repository includes the source code of the paper, "New observational recipes for measuring dynamical state of galaxy clusters" Kim et al 2024.
In the arranged folder, there are two to four dimensional rotation matrix method python codes with test data of observational (HeCS) and simulation data (N_cluster run simulation). Detailed information about the rotation method can be found in the paper.

Users can use and revise the codes, but you have to notify me when you publish your version of the code to the public.
The test data sets should not be shared unauthorized persons, and do not make results using only the test data set.

If you have any questions and need help for using code, please let me know. It's always welcome.
